1. 3 (L1 Data, L1 Instruction, L2 Unified) Yes, there is a separate L1 cache for data and instructions.
2.  L1 Data: 128KB
    L1 Instruction: 128KB
    L2 Unified: 8MB
3. 64B
4. Direct-mapped
5.  Offset bits: 6B
    Index bits: 8B
    Tag bits: 50B

    Offset bits = log2(block size)
    Index bits = log2(number of sets)
    Tag bits: Total address bits - Index bits - Offset bits
