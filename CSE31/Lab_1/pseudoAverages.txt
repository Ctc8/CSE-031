// Discussed pseudocode with Purab Mecwan, Jaden Yang

int main(){

    Get user to input a number
    End while loop when 0 is entered

    Function to get the "digit sum" of the numbers
    int sumOfDigits(int n){
        int sum = 0;
        while (n != 0){
            sum = sum + n % 10;
            n = n / 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }

    // Check if sum is even or odd
    if (sum % 2 == 0){
        count1 = 0;
        int totalEven = 0;

        totalEven = totalEven + sum;
        Increment counter based on number of even numbers
    }
    
    else {
        count2 = 0;
        int totalOdd = 0;

        totalOdd = totalOdd + sum;
        Increment counter based on number of odd numbers
    }
}


1, Get user to input number in a while loop
2. Determine if the digit sum of the number is even or odd (make function)
3. If the digit sum is even then add it to a total of EVEN sum
4. If the digit sum is odd then add it to a total of ODD sum
5. Keep track of ordinal numbering with use of remainders/modulo operator
6. If the user inputs 0, end the program and print the averages of odd and even digit sums
