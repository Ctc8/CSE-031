Assignment 1:
1. Line 23
2. Retrieve address of input using & operator.
3. Sum is not being dereferenced. The memory is being lost so the sum is constantly being divided by 0 which always results in 0.
4. Add a dereference operator * to sum.

Assignment 2:
1. The output is expected.
2. The output is not expected. The result included the previous "hello!" string.
3. The output is not expected. The first string is not included at all. I think this may have happened due to an overflow of elements inside of the allocated space for the array.
