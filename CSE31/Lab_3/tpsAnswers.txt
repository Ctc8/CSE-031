TPS 1:
1.  Static storage: global variable storage, basically permanent, entire program run
    Stack: local variable storage, parameters, return address
    Heap: (dynamic malloc storage), data lives until deallocated by programmer
2.  a) 3 variables are declared
    b) 2 are pointers, both of type int
    c)  int num: Stack
        int *ptr: Stack, the values of these pointers are on the heap
        int **handle: Stack, the values of these pointers are on the heap
    d)  Heap, since memory is being allocated
3.  ...
4.  ...

TPS 2:
1.  Construction of a linked list with 3 nodes with a node pointer pointing to the next node. 
2.  ...
3.  The struct is allocated on the stack. However, the head* is allocated on the heap because of the use of malloc().
